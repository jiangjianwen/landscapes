Building
---





```

    git clone https://github.com/realazthat/landscapes.git
    cd landscapes

    #install dependencies, there are some bash scripts provided in the ./scripts/ directory
    # that will download and build many of the dependencies and put them in the ./libs directory
    # the scripts are meant for the continuous integration system, but you can run them yourself
    # or read them for assistance.
    
    #optionally install or download and build googletest (only matters if you are going to run the unittests)
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    #see the bash scripts for for more details
    CMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" bash ./scripts/download-and-build-googletest.sh
    #... etc. install dependencies


    #make a build directory
    mkdir -p build && cd build

    
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
    
    #if you built the dependencies and put them in the libs directory, then you are good to build
    
    #if you installed the dependencies to the system, you are prolly good to build
    
    #if you built the dependencies yourself outside the expected ./libs subdirectories, then you will need to
    # define/override the paths to the projects (which by default point to the ./libs directory)
    # for example, like so:
    cmake -L # list all the user-definable variables
    cmake . -DGLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/cppformat/include -DGLFW3_LIB=glfw3 -DGLFW3_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glfw/build/src
    # .. and so on for each dependency that is not in the ./libs directory and not installed in the system
    #alternatively, we can set these via the GUI
    cmake-gui .
    
    #build the targets you want to build
    cmake --build . --target landscapes
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc-demo
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc-zorder-genconsts
    cmake --build . --target unittests
    # ... etc.

    #execute the unittests if you want to
    ./unittests

    #see ./scripts/rebuild.it.all.for.msys.sh for how the integration tests do it

```
