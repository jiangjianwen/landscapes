Dependencies
----

Requires C++14 compatible compiler. Tested with:

* windows/msys2/mingw-w64/gcc (windows 7)
* linux/gcc (ubuntu)


Build system:

* CMake >= 3.1 (if using CMake)
* git (only if building dependencies from source)
* mercurial (only if building dependencies from source)

Libraries:

* To build core landscapes:
    * cubelib
    * [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/)
        * High-perf math library, useful for vectorized ops required for graphics, and also useful for
            opencl-compatible shim/layer
        * Tested with commit [78f686b](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tree/78f686b4be6c623df829db58b974bf8d79461987)

    * [bprinter](https://github.com/dattanchu/bprinter/wiki)
        * Pretty-printed tables, useful for debugging
        * Tested with commit [29531dc](https://github.com/dattanchu/bprinter/tree/29531dcecceb99d759a196f5e44b4729abe18bed)
        * BSD License
    * [cppformat](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat)
        * Formatting strings for C++, mostly useful for debugging, error messages etc.
        * Tested with commit [4797ca0](https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat/tree/4797ca025eef17b8df42edd8c9bde83c43806bf1)

Building
---





```

    git clone https://github.com/realazthat/landscapes.git
    cd landscapes

    #install dependencies, there are some bash scripts provided in the ./scripts/ directory
    # that will download and build many of the dependencies and put them in the ./libs directory
    # the scripts are meant for the continuous integration system, but you can run them yourself
    # or read them for assistance.
    
    #optionally install or download and build googletest (only matters if you are going to run the unittests)
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    #see the bash scripts for for more details
    CMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" bash ./scripts/download-and-build-googletest.sh
    #... etc. install dependencies


    #make a build directory
    mkdir -p build && cd build

    
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
    
    #if you built the dependencies and put them in the libs directory, then you are good to build
    
    #if you installed the dependencies to the system, you are prolly good to build
    
    #if you built the dependencies yourself outside the expected ./libs subdirectories, then you will need to
    # define/override the paths to the projects (which by default point to the ./libs directory)
    # for example, like so:
    cmake -L # list all the user-definable variables
    cmake . -DGLFW3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/cppformat/include -DGLFW3_LIB=glfw3 -DGLFW3_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glfw/build/src
    # .. and so on for each dependency that is not in the ./libs directory and not installed in the system
    #alternatively, we can set these via the GUI
    cmake-gui .
    
    #build the targets you want to build
    cmake --build . --target landscapes
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc-demo
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc-zorder-genconsts
    cmake --build . --target unittests
    # ... etc.

    #execute the unittests if you want to
    ./unittests

    #see ./scripts/rebuild.it.all.for.msys.sh for how the integration tests do it

```
