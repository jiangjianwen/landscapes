Building
---





```

    git clone https://github.com/realazthat/landscapes.git
    cd landscapes


    #optionally download and build googletest (only matters if you are going to run the unittests)
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    CMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" bash ./scripts/download-and-build-googletest.sh

    #optionally download and build dependencies
    #note, choose the appropriate generator
    CMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" bash ./scripts/download-and-build-libs-with-no-pkg.sh



    rm -rf ./build
    mkdir -p build && cd build

    cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" ..
    cmake --build . --target landscapes
    cmake --build . --target landscapes-mc
    # ... etc.




    #optionally build and execut the unittests
    cmake --build . --target unittests
    ./unittests


```
